# Rules and Procedures
## Rules
>[!TODO] TODO:
>If you have created a prototype, describing the rules of your game will be much easier. You will need to define all the game objects, concepts, their behaviors, and how they relate to one another in this section. Since you are doing board games, you should add (if needed) the rulebook as an appendix and reference here!

## Procedures
>[!TODO] TODO:
>Describe here everything on how the game is played from beginning to end. Explain how a turn is done and what can affect the different states

# Scoring and Winning Condition
>[!TODO] TODO:
>Describe the scoring system and win conditions. These might be different for single player versus multiplayer or if you have several modes of competition.
